# Flappy Bird Clone

This repository is a remake of the popular game Flappy Birds. The repository includes two branches: master, which is the original game of Flappy Birds and ToyGeneticAlgo, which is the game played by AI. The AI neuroevolutionary meaning it is a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms. The idea here is that our AI will learn through sequential generations how to play the game Flappy Birds.
